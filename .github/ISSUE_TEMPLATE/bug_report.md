**Describe the bug**
A clear and concise description of what the bug is.

**To Reproduce**
If it is a bug you encountered while working with the library, you should produce a code sample that allows us to reproduce the problem... If we cannot reproduce the problem, it might be hard for us to fix it...

**Java version:**

Please tell us which Java version you are using.



[For up-to-date releases, we recommend configuring maven and gradle to depend on the bintray repository](https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/BT/Maven+Repositories). Our experience with Maven Central at Sonatype is poor: releases disappear or are unexplicably delayed.
