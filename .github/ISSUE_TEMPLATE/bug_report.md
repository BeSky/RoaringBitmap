[For up-to-date releases, we recommend configuring maven and gradle to depend on the bintray repository](https://stackoverflow.com/a/44549422/73007). Our experience with Maven Central at Sonatype is poor and the platform is considered legacy. Please consult the [bintray documentation](https://bintray.com/roaringbitmap/maven/org.roaringbitmap%3ARoaringBitmap) for help setting your build configuration.



**Java version:**

Please tell us which Java version you are using.
